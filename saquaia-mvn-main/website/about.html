<p>For a more detailed description of SeQuaiA, please refer to the <a href="doc.html">Documentation</a>. This quickstart guide assumes no extensive knowledge of chemical reaction networks (CRNs). However, some background on the traditional analysis of CRNs is beneficial.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>SeQuaiA is written in Java 11 and does not support Java 8. Make sure you have the correct Java runtime environment installed on your operating system.</p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>Make sure you have downloaded the correct <code>sequaia.jar</code>. Currently, we have builds for Windows, Mac OS and Ubuntu. Other Linux distributions might be supported as well, but we have only tested the build on Ubuntu.</p>
<h2 id="running-sequaia">Running SeQuaiA</h2>
<p>Navigate to the directory where <code>sequaia.jar</code> is located, then run <code>java -jar sequaia.jar</code>. It might take a few seconds before the GUI opens. If nothings happens, make sure you have downloaded the correct version.</p>

<p>You can also click on the <code>sequaia.jar</code> file. Make sure you have permission to execute the <code>sequaia.jar</code>. Run <code>chmod +x sequaia.jar</code> to give permission to execute.</p>
